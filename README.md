# Study Bot

Study Bot is a Discord bot that will help students find partners to study with.
Students will be able to find other students looking for people to work with,
then have a Discord channel created for them to work together.

## Initial Goals

- Initial ways for students to register, unregister, and add courses to the bot.

## Setup instructions

- You'll need to create a Discord bot and get a token for it. You can do this
  [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
    - First, you'll create a bot user. You can name it whatever you want.
    - Then, you'll need to get the token for the bot. You can do this by clicking
        "click to reveal token" under the bot's username.
    - You'll also need to invite the bot to your server. You can do this by going
        to the OAuth2 tab, checking the "bot" scope, and then copying the URL
        that is generated. You can then paste that URL into your browser and
        invite the bot to your server.

In the terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
